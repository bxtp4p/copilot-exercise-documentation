# Documenting an Existing Codebase

This exercise focuses on generating clear and comprehensive documentation for a codebase using GitHub Copilot. You will work with an MVC-based application and use AI-driven prompt engineering to create meaningful documentation for developers.

## Overview

The goal of this exercise is to use GitHub Copilot to generate high-quality documentation for the Task App. You will create an overview of the application's architecture, describe its key components, and provide detailed explanations of its main classes and methods. Supporting diagrams will also be used to visualize the application's structure and interactions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this exercise, you will be able to:
1. **Generate High-Level Documentation**: Use AI to create an overall description of the application's purpose, architecture, and flow.
2. **Document Components and Interactions**: Provide detailed explanations of the application's model, view, controller, and API.
3. **Explain Class Responsibilities**: Break down the main classes and methods, describing their roles and how they interact with each other.
4. **Utilize Visual Diagrams**: Leverage diagrams to illustrate the application's structure and relationships between its components.
5. **Iterate on Documentation**: Refine AI-generated documentation to ensure clarity, completeness, and accuracy.

## Setup

To get started, clone the [Task App repository](https://github.com/bxtp4p/copilot-app-taskapp) and follow the instructions in the README to set up the project on your local machine.

## Problem Statement

The current Task App codebase lacks sufficient documentation, making it difficult for developers to understand the application’s structure and functionality. The complexity of the MVC pattern and its interactions would greatly benefit from clear, organized, and thorough documentation.

## Task

Using GitHub Copilot, generate the following documentation for the Task App:

1. **High-Level Overview**:
   - Explain the purpose of the application and how it functions within the MVC framework.
   
2. **Component Breakdown**:
   - Describe the roles of the Model, View, and Controller in the application, along with the API and how they interact.

3. **Class and Method Descriptions**:
   - Detail the primary classes and methods, their functionality, and how they work together within the application.

4. **Supporting Diagrams**:
   - Create diagrams to help visualize key elements of the application, such as class relationships, data flow, and component interactions. (Consider using Mermaid or other diagramming tools.)

## Expected Outcome

By the end of this exercise, you should have a complete, developer-friendly set of documentation that:

- Provides a clear overview of the application’s purpose and design.
- Explains the roles of key components and their interactions.
- Describes the core classes and methods in detail, making it easier for new developers to understand and work with the codebase.
- Includes visual aids to improve comprehension of the application’s architecture.

## Tips

- **Refining AI Suggestions**: GitHub Copilot might not generate perfect documentation on the first try. Use the AI’s suggestions as a starting point and refine them as needed.
- **Asking for Help**: If you’re unsure about how to generate certain parts of the documentation or need clarification, ask GitHub Copilot Chat for help. For example, if you need assistance with diagrams, you could ask, *"What types of diagrams does Mermaid support?"* to explore different visualization options.
- **Utilize GitHub Copilot Chat Commands**: If you need help interacting with GitHub Copilot Chat, use the `/help` command to view available commands.

## Example Solution

An example of completed documentation can be found in the [`copilot-exercise-documentation-completed`](https://github.com/bxtp4p/copilot-app-taskapp/tree/copilot-exercise-documentation-completed) branch of the [Task App repository](https://github.com/bxtp4p/copilot-app-taskapp). Note that this is just one possible solution, and results may vary based on how you use GitHub Copilot. You are encouraged to experiment and iterate on your documentation approach. If you're stuck, refer to the [completed](https://github.com/bxtp4p/copilot-exercise-documentation/tree/completed) branch for prompts and guidance. Prompts are located in the `/completed` directory.
