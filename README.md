# Documenting an Existing Codebase

This exercise focuses on documentation. Use GitHub Copilot to generate documentation for the code in this exercise. Use the [Task App](https://github.com/bxtp4p/copilot-app-taskapp) to complete this exercise.

## Instructions

This exercise uses the [Task App](https://github.com/bxtp4p/copilot-app-taskapp). Clone the repository and follow the instructions in the README to get started.

## Problem

The code in this application doesn't contain enough documentation to help developers understand how it works. It is a complex MVC application that would benefit from having a more complete and robust set of documentation.

## Task

Use GitHub Copilot to generate documentation for the code in this exercise. The documentation should include:

- A high-level overview of the application, including its purpose and how it works.
- A description of the main components of the application, including the model, view, and controller, as well as the API.
- A description of the main classes and methods in the application, including what they do and how they interact with each other.
- Supporting diagrams to help visualize how the application works.

## Expected Outcome

The documentation should provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the application, including how it works and why it was designed the way it was. The documentation should be easy to read and understand, even for developers who are not familiar with the codebase.

## Tips

- Don't expect GitHub Copilot to produce perfect results, all of the time. It's a tool to help you write code, but it's up to you to decide what to do with its suggestions. Feel free to modify the code as you see fit.

- If you don't understand how to do something, or if you get stuck, don't hesitate to ask GitHub Copilot Chat for help. Think of it as a seasoned expert in the thing you're trying to do who can help guide you in the right direction. Don't be afraid to ask it questions! For example, if you don't know what kinds of diagrams Mermaid supports, you could ask "What kinds of diagrams does Mermaid support?" and it will give you a list of the supported diagram types.

- Use the `/help` command in GitHub Copilot Chat to get a list of commands you can use to interact with.

An example result of this exercise can be found in the [`copilot-exercise-documentation-completed`](https://github.com/bxtp4p/copilot-app-taskapp/tree/copilot-exercise-documentation-completed) branch of the [Task App](https://github.com/bxtp4p/copilot-app-taskapp). Note that this is just one possible solution as GitHub Copilot is generative and the results may be different on each iteration. Feel free to experiment and try different approaches. If you're still stuck, you can refer to the [completed](https://github.com/bxtp4p/copilot-exercise-documentation/tree/completed) branch in this repo for the prompts used to generate the results. Prompts will be located in the `/completed` directory.
